	<center><p class="paragraph"> The best way to solve poverty-caused slavery is to educate, feed and give (healthcare, shelter, safety) to the vulnerable people in poverty to avoid vulnerability to slavery in poverty. This will be achieved with the EASY (Educate, Act/Aid, Save and Yield) Program. The EASY Program will focus on main causes of poverty and ease the struggle of poverty and slavery by educating, acting/aiding, saving and yielding. Educating can open the eyes of people in poverty about slavery, and Acting/aiding can Save the people who are already too far into poverty or slavery and finally the program will Yield the actions taking when acting and saving take place. This program will Yield healthcare, shelter, safety and education to fulfill the EASY promise. This solution is most effective because a major cause of slavery is the vulnerability of people who are under the poverty threshold (Stroede). The E in EASY stands for educate, which UNICEF has said is the strongest key to protect children from poverty (“Goal: Eradicate Extreme”). According to the data provided if the EASY Program educates those vulnerable in poverty about slavery warnings, so they can stay away, it will work. Justifying that the program will aid and act towards those who need health care to prevent them from becoming desperate, leading them to slavery. UNICEF may have set a goal to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030, and that may leave people a little too hopeful. However, the EASY Program promises to reveal the truth of how long it would take to truly eradicate the problem. The program will save and yield to those already too far into poverty or slavery, by feeding them and caring for them. With the programs that will develop, feed or educate jobs will be given to those unemployed in underdeveloped countries.

  <p class="paragraph"> There has only been a good outcome seen in Ghana from all of Africa with the school feeding program which is now seen in 4,700 schools all over Ghana (“Ending Poverty in”). A solution only working in one country of all the 54 countries in Africa enforced by the World Bank. Though this feeding program was a very smart and enforced project, it needs to be improved if clear benefits are only seen in one country, the EASY program will need to take over. The EASY Program will avoid this by not basing feeding stations in schools. But, in the most centered areas of the african country at hand. The freedom project consists in four different countries, Thailand, Burma, Philippines and India (“What We Do”). The freedom project may be popular and successful to prevent slavery, but they only exist in four developing countries.

  <p class="paragraph"> Since poverty clearly causes vulnerability which can lead to the modern slavery seen today, solving this problem with development makes more sense (Sameth). Clearly, with all tried solutions seen, successful or not, development in the country itself is needed to erase the term of vulnerability. The EASY Program will work tirelessly in many underdeveloped countries in order to best prevent and stop slavery. The EASY Program uses what has been seen to best resolve poverty/slavery and secure the EASY promise. If the EASY Program improves from World Bank's’ and the Freedom Project’s mistakes, then the program will regulate and adjust poverty/slavery by being honorable and responsible. Initially, the solution was to solve this issue with international donors, but no matter the commitment and desire in seeing children and women thrive out of poverty and slavery, it won’t be enough to cover the costs. That’s why this letter is being sent to the president of the World Bank, if you believe in the EASY Program then the countries will too. The EASY Program should be focused in South Asia, South-East Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and East Asia. Especially, Sub-Saharan Africa, because every region has been decreasing but Sub-Saharan Africa has risen and stayed put (Shah). Working together will fulfill the financial need to have this program succeed. With this program introduced and the World Bank working with it step by step, the world will truly believe they still have a chance. A chance that the promise of equality is to be granted to the innocent people left desperate.
